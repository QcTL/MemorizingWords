# MemorizingWords

## **Summary**
This repo is an application created with pygame to improve memory by giving you a set of words to memorize. And when you press start, the words will disappear, and you have to type them out again.
This application includes a slider of difficulty that will change the maximum length of words shown to you. You can press the X on the word if a particular word is too complicated, and it will reroll another one.
This app uses a .txt containing a dictionary of all the words the user will encounter. By default, it's a dictionary transformed into .txt to make it able to read it.
